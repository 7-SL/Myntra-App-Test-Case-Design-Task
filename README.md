# Myntra-App-Test-Case-Design-Task
During my Software Testing training, I worked on a group assignment focused on designing test cases for a real-time application. The task assigned by the trainer was for each group to select one application and each group member was responsible for creating test cases for that selected application.
As part of my individual contribution, I designed and documented 14 test cases covering multiple testing levels:
Functional Testing, Integration Testing, System Testing

- Skills & Knowledge Gained
Test case design and documentation
Understanding application workflows and user scenarios
Identifying test scenarios, expected results, and validations
Team collaboration and task coordination
Practical exposure to different software testing levels

This task helped me strengthen my understanding of software testing concepts and improved my analytical and defect-identification skills.
